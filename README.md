# 💤 tabNap v0.2.0 

**A lightweight Chromium-based browser extension to automatically put inactive tabs to sleep after 5 minutes — saving memory and boosting your browsing performance.**

---

## 🚀 Feature Update (v0.2.0)

In version **v0.2.0**, Tab Nap just got smarter.

### 🔄 What’s New

* **Ignore List Support**
  You no longer need to *pin* tabs to prevent them from being discarded.
  Now, you can simply **add websites to an ignore list**—those tabs will stay safe, even when inactive.

* **Settings Panel**
  Click “See More Settings” in the popup to manage your ignored sites:

  * Type or paste any website URL
  * Hit **Save Site**
  * It’s added to your ignore list instantly

### ✅ Example Use Case

Want to keep WhatsApp Web or Notion running in the background?
Just add `https://web.whatsapp.com` or `https://notion.so` to the list. Tab Nap will leave them alone.



## 🚀 Features

- Automatically hibernates inactive tabs after 5 minutes  
- Skips pinned tabs (they stay awake)
- Now supports custom ignore list for domains you don’t want discarded
- Runs silently in the background  
- Minimal UI to toggle the feature ON/OFF  
- Lightweight and efficient
